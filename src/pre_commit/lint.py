"""
This module is where all of the linting logic is defined.

Adding linters for additional languages is easy: just add a new
"lint_<language_name>" method to the `Lint` class.

A "lint_<language_name>" method must implement the following behavior:
1) accept a list of file paths as input
2) select only the files that are relevant to <language_name>
   (e.g. by looking at file extensions that relate to <language_name>)
3) produce two pieces of output:
    - send all linting information to stdout (if any issues are detected)
    - return the number of files that have linting issues.

Note that you can use the `Linter` convenience class in the
`src.pre_commit.linters` module to implement additional linters.
