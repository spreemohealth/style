# What is this?
This repository contains code used to manage and enforce style/code checking in the `spreemohealth` GitHub organization.

## Configuring a pre-commit hook
**This section explains how to configure a client-level pre-commit hook for a target Git repository.**

---

Currently, this hook performs code checking on your commits for the following languages:
- **Python** (i.e. `.py` files), using `flake8`
- **R** (i.e. `.r` or `.R` files), using `lintr`.

In short, the hook works as follows: *if you commit code that does not pass the inspection, your commit will be rejected.*
When this happens, simply make the appropriate edits to your code and commit again.

---

1. Please make sure that Python 3 and R are both installed on your system.

   *Note that in this example, `python` and `pip` point to my Homebrew Python 3 distribution.*
   *If you are using a different distribution, please make the appropriate changes in the commands that follow.*

2. Make sure that the Python `flake8` module is installed for Python 3:
   ```bash
   pip install flake8 --upgrade
   ```

3. Make sure that the R `lintr` package is installed:
   ```bash
   R -e "install.packages('lintr', repos='https://cloud.r-project.org')"
   ```

4. Clone this repository on your system (say in `~/Git/style`) and `cd` into it.

5. Run the installer on the target repository (e.g. `~/Git/my-linty-repo` in the following example):
   ```bash
   python install_pre_commit_hook ~/Git/my-linty-repo
   ```

   If you want, you can perform the installation on more than one target repository:
   ```bash
   python install_pre_commit_hook ~/Git/my-linty-repo ~/Git/my-linty-repo2 ... 
   ```

6. Your pre-commit hook should now be correctly configured.

### Adding linters
Adding support for additional programming languages is relatively straightforward.
You just have to add a `lint_<language>` method to the `Lint` class in the `src.pre_commit.lint` module.

A linter is expected to:
- accept a single input: *a list of file paths*, corresponding to files that are in the git staging area
- select only the files that are relevant to the language being checked
- produce two pieces of output:
   1. send all linting information to stdout for the user (if any issues are detected)
   2. return the number of files that have style issues.

Note that the `Linter` class in `src.pre_commit.linters` can be used as a wrapper to implement linters for different programming languages.
See the implementation of `lint_py` and `lint_r` for more details.

### How to avoid code checking
Generally, you want *all* of your code to be checked without exceptions.
However, there may be special circumstances under which you may desire to exclude a line or a block of code from being checked.
This section explains how to do this for the supported languages (more details can be found in the documentation of the relevant packages).

**Use wisely.**

#### Python - `flake8`
You can exclude an entire file from being checked by including the following line at the top of it:
```python
# flake8: noqa
```

Use the `# noqa` inline comment to exclude a single line:
```python
# this line will raise an error
a= 1 

# this line will not raise an error,
# because it is excluded from code checking
b =2 # noqa
```

You can exclude specific errors on a line with `# noqa: <error>`, e.g. `# noqa: E234`.

#### R - `lintr`
Use the `# nolint` inline comment to exclude a given line:
```R
# this line will raise an error
a= 1

# this line will not raise an error,
# because it is excluded from code checking
b =2 # nolint
```

You can exclude an entire block of code like so:
```R
# the following block will not raise errors
# because it is excluded from code checking

# nolint start
a= 1
b =2
# nolint end

# this line will raise an error
x <- c(1,2, 3)
```
